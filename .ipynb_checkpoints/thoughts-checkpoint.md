### My Thoughts on Both Sessions
Comparing both sessions, Session 2 with the Mollick structured tutor prompt definitely felt more like a tutor and like I was talking to a person than Session 1 where it was unstructured. Some main differences I noticed was that Session 1 had much longer formats and was a lot of information all at once while Session 2 seemed much more tailored with shorter responses. I felt like the tutor in Session 2 cared about me more and was definitely more concerned with my progress by asking at first for example how I execute a wing. However, I thought it was interesting and almost funny how the tutor in Session 2 stopped when I said that I wanted a cupcake instead of insisting more on evidence of student understanding from the prompt. For Session 1, it did not feel like the chatbot was invested in my progress at all, but focused on trying to teach me the basics. I did catch the model providing wrong answers for step explanations at times and corrected it. When I was going a little off track, I thought that Session 1 did a good job of trying to keep me focused on tap dancing while Session 2 just ended after I said that I wanted a cupcake because it sensed that I was not focused anymore.
